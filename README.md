## About Footsteps
This is the first game I made, and the first time I've used processing. The game is very simple. Each player enters a number of points they are willing to bet without the other player seeing. The player with the most points has the footsteps move towards their side of the sidewalk. Once both players are out of points, the winner is decided based on whose side of the sidewalk the footsteps are on.

## Instructions
You must have Processing installed on your computer and run the footsteps folder as a sketch.
